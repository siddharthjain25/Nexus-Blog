Artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of techniques that enable computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This short guide gives you a practical starting point for understanding AI and building small projects you can experiment with today.

## 1. Core concepts

- Data: AI systems learn from data — examples, measurements, or observations.
- Model: A program (often a statistical or neural network) that maps inputs to outputs.
- Training: The process of adjusting model parameters so it performs well on the data.
- Inference: Using a trained model to make predictions on new inputs.

## 2. Simple project ideas

- Text classification: Label short texts (e.g., spam vs. not spam) using a small classifier.
- Image classifier: Train a model to recognize a few classes (cats vs. dogs) using transfer learning.
- Chatbot prototype: Use a pretrained language model API to build a conversational UI.

## 3. Practical steps to get started

1. Pick a problem small enough to collect data for (hundreds to a few thousand examples).
2. Explore the data: check class balance and quality.
3. Choose a baseline model (logistic regression, small neural network, or an API).
4. Train, evaluate, and iterate.
5. Deploy a simple web UI to collect feedback and more data.

## 4. Tools and resources

- Python: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `fastai`, `transformers`.
- JavaScript: `tensorflow.js`, model API services (OpenAI, Hugging Face APIs).
- Datasets: Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, Hugging Face Datasets.

## 5. Responsible practices

Start small, be mindful of privacy and bias in your data, and evaluate models on real-world criteria (accuracy, fairness, and robustness).
